From Harald Hammarstr√∂m:

- I don't know what Os and Dj stand for in B71a_Teke_Os, B71a_Teke_Dj but if they are B71A 
  the id should be Tegue of the Alima/Gabon [teg].
- Lega is ambiguous between Lega Shabunda and Lega Mwenda, I have reason to suspect this 
  is Lega Shabunda because that's the one Stappert worked on and I bet they got their wordlist 
  from there.
- The D20B_Vamba vocabulary (it's been discussed a couple of times in the literature)  
  probably did not come from a native speaker, but purports to be Amba [rwm] so I've assigned 
  it that id.
- The D313_Mbuttu_1919 is often taken to be a variant of Vanuma, but that's based on 
  impressionistic comparison, their paper puts it closer to Bodo, so I've id:d it as Bodo.
- Nyiha and Emakhua are to specified to region but those bare names usually mean 
  Central Nyiha and Central Emakhua so I've id:d them so.
- Based on Philippson's other publications (the data is from him), JE32_Luyia could only be
  Masaaba, Isuxa, Logooli, or Saamia. Saamia [lsm] is the largest one and also the one the 
  missionaries tried to use for standardisation so one might as well guess JE32_Luyia is Saamia [lsm].
