## Notes

## Language mapping

From Harald Hammarstr√∂m:

- I don't know what Os and Dj stand for in B71a_Teke_Os, B71a_Teke_Dj but if they are B71A 
  the id should be Tegue of the Alima/Gabon [teg].
- Lega is ambiguous between Lega Shabunda and Lega Mwenda, I have reason to suspect this 
  is Lega Shabunda because that's the one Stappert worked on and I bet they got their wordlist 
  from there.
- The D20B_Vamba vocabulary (it's been discussed a couple of times in the literature)  
  probably did not come from a native speaker, but purports to be Amba [rwm] so I've assigned 
  it that id.
- The D313_Mbuttu_1919 is often taken to be a variant of Vanuma, but that's based on 
  impressionistic comparison, their paper puts it closer to Bodo, so I've id:d it as Bodo.
- Nyiha and Emakhua are to specified to region but those bare names usually mean 
  Central Nyiha and Central Emakhua so I've id:d them so.
- Based on Philippson's other publications (the data is from him), JE32_Luyia could only be
  Masaaba, Isuxa, Logooli, or Saamia. Saamia [lsm] is the largest one and also the one the 
  missionaries tried to use for standardisation so one might as well guess JE32_Luyia is Saamia [lsm].

## Consonant Clusters

The orthography profile is only an approximation. There remain quite a few cases where we could not decide what the pronunciation is, due to ambiguities. We left them in this form, but ask kindly to check upon this, when running any kind of analysis in which the phonetic transcriptions of this dataset are important.
